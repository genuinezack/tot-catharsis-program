# You did it

You made it through the day. And the week. And the month. You've been through so much. Frustration, worry, anxiety, anger, and tourists blocking the sidewalk. And you've kept it all in! Holding in those feelings, trying to keep it together.

Well it's time to stop keeping it together.

## **It's time to let it all out.**

# **WELCOME TO CATHARSISFEST.**

You have arrived at a carnival of rage, passion, and recovery. Here, you'll find everything you need to achieve that beautiful bliss, that delicious release, that near-religious experience of CATHARSIS. Ask yourself: what do you need tonight to feel good? to feel at peace? to release? Do you need to hurl some sharp objects at a face that drives you insane? Head over to target practice and pick your victim. Do you need to get something deep and dark off your chest? A confession booth awaits you, ready to take your sins off your chest. Do you need to feel beautiful? A skilled face and body painter is waiting for you, rainbow palette at the ready.

Tonight, you will see performances from fierce artists who want to make you howl and laugh and cry. You will have your choice of cathartic carnival activities, a smorgasbord of forbidden delights. You'll dance, you'll drink, you'll party. This phone in your hand can show you what awaits you. Just click **FEATURING** above to see what's coming next, or **BROUGHT TO YOU BY** to learn more about your friendly neighborhood catharsis experts.

You've earned this. You deserve this. Let it all out.
