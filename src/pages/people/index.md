      From the moment we saw the dirty photo collage covered walls of the
      bathrooms upstairs, we knew we could make some serious, sexy, powerful art
      here. NuBlu is also THE place for sultry jazz festivals, amazing
      cocktails, and dancing any night of the week. Each of their three
      locations has its own wonderful vibe and you can catch Torn Out
      collaborators sipping drinks in the backyard of NuBlu Classic, on the
      terrace inside NuBlu 151, and by the jukebox in NuBlu 151 Studio with some
      frequency. We couldn't think of a better second home base for our work
      after Prospect Park.

      The gorgeous photograph you see at the top of this page is not body paint,
      clothing, or photo filters! It's a sumptuous light bath by local artist
      Jarid Blue. Blue bathes people in light (paintings, digital works, and
      photographs by him and his collaborators), letting them get as comfortable
      as they like, so that they may relish the feeling of their bodies in that
      glow, and then he captures these glorious moments as photographs. A
      like-minded appreciator of the human body, Blue has donated a
      single-edition print of this perfectly lush poster for one lucky raffle
      winner to take home at Catharsis Fest!

      This Brooklyn-based brand not only has the most beautiful, all-natural,
      woody, smokey, salty, perfect smelling things to add to your life, they

      Incausa uses market forces to do good and empower indigenous communities.
      If you're wondering how you can avoid contributing to the problems caused

      can help the affected communities, start by stopping in Incausa's showroom
      on India Street. These are the experts! Their brilliance is matched only
      by their kindness. We are grateful and humbled to be partnering with them

      Each of these tantalizing pops is handmade with more love than you can
      possibly imagine by our dear friend and concocter of herbal magic, Jena
      Chambers. They are startlingly beautiful to look at - shimmering minerals
      peek through naturally colored sugar, delicious to eat - fruity, floral,
      herby, and succulent, and really work! Pandora's Pops pack serious herbal
      power with herbs like damiana. There's a pop for every occasion, from
      tenth dates to hangovers to work all-nighters. Lucky Catharsis Kit
      purchasers will get to try the limited edition flavor Howling Pillows made
      just for us!

      Nestled just off the beaten path in Williamsburg, Shag provides a wealth
      of experiential learning in human sexuality just by walking through its
      doors. Part apothecary, part gallery, part flea market, part lingerie
      closet, and part toy chest, there is truly something for everyone. Owners
      Samantha and Ashley, and mascot Frankie the dog, bring together art,
      sexuality, and experience in a completely new way that is worth a visit.
      One lucky Catharsis Fest raffle winner will definitely be doing just that
      as they'll be nabbing a Shag gift certificate as well as a luxury
      all-gender toy from Lelo, and so much lube.

      When we started looking for labels for our custom DIY floggers (available
      to make for yourself at catharsis fest!), we were overwhelmed with the
      ordering process and order minimums at most sites. We also just couldn't
      find what we were looking for. Then we found Woven Label Source. It was
      painless and easy to create exactly the vegan leather labels we had in
      mind. When we explained to Gene, the account executive, that we were
      making these for a nonprofit theater company fundraising event, he decided
      to gift the entire order in order to support our art! We can't thank Gene
      enough and we can't stress enough that if you're looking for professional,
      detailed, perfect fabric tags of any kind, that he's the one to go to.

      Miss Birdy does everything from face painting to singing in a rock band,
      but mostly she works with kids. She sees makeup as a fun way to play with
      putting your insides on your outside and NOT as a way to conform to
      socially imposed standards on femininity (unless you feel like it). Her
      style is heavy on the rainbows and glitter but she's happy to paint you
      however makes you feel most true to yourself. missbirdy.com
