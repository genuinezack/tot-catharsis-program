      Bad News Bear is a non-binary drag performer who has been performing in
      Brooklyn and Manhattan for the past two years. A Queen, King, and Quing;
      Bad News Bear is a genderfucked clown-punk merbabe. But most importantly,
      Bad News Bear is a nazi-bashing mess. You can see Bad News Bear kittening
      and performing at the twice monthly punk drag show, Queer as in Fuck You
      at Otto's Shrunken Head. Their next upcoming performance is Pan, a drag
      and burlesque showcase of Peter Pan, on June 14 at the Huron Club.

      Miss Birdy does everything from face painting to singing in a rock band,
      but mostly she works with kids. She sees makeup as a fun way to play with
      putting your insides on your outside and NOT as a way to conform to
      socially imposed standards on femininity (unless you feel like it). Her
      style is heavy on the rainbows and glitter but she's happy to paint you
      however makes you feel most true to yourself. missbirdy.com

      Maddie Jaina is a singer-songwriter and theater artist. They like really
      sad songs but generally think the ways in which they approach life are
      pretty positive. They produce a monthly event called “What Should I Call
      This?” that brings together music and drag (and admittedly some partying).
      You can catch the next one at Kingsland on June 22nd for some disco
      inspired tunes! Maddie graduated with their BFA from the New School for
      Drama and has not ever thought about moving back to Ohio.
