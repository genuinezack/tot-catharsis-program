      Nell is a British Actor and Producer living and experimenting in the US.
      Having trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and Barnard College,
      Nell is currently working with Killer Films and playing in the creative
      pool of NYC. She is very excited to be involved in Torn Out's
      Catharsisfest, as she is desperately in need of some post-grad cathartic
