      Psst. Tell us your secret. Confess your deepest fears, your regrets, your
      hopes you're afraid to say out loud  – or eavesdrop on other people's
      confessions anonymously! /// 2 tokens: confession booth visit, but
      remember someone is listening! /// 3 tokens: confess off the record! No
      one will ever hear; we'll take it to the grave. /// 2 tokens: we’ll email
      you a random confession (with voice distortion, so you’ll never know who
      said it) /// 10 tokens: we’ll email you ALL the confessions from tonight.

      Is it just us, or is Mexican food inherently cathartic? Either way, The
