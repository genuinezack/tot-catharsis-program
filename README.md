This is the single-purpose site for the digital program for Torn Out Theater's Catharsisfest 2019. It was created by me, @genuinezack, mostly as an experiment with NetlifyCMS and Gatsby.

## Getting Started (Without Netlify)

$ # clone this repository
$ cd tot-catharsis-program

```

This will start a local dev server on http://localhost:8000
